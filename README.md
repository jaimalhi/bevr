## Project Overview

**Idea**  
Bevr is an Android app that helps users record and remember all the beverages they've tried so they can revisit the good ones and avoid the bad ones. Over time, the app highlights top-rated drinks and the best locations based on personal taste data.

**What Makes It New**  
Existing apps usually focus on one beverage category (e.g., beer, wine, or coffee) and target niche demographics. Bevr takes a **universal and minimal approach**, simple enough for anyone who enjoys beverages, regardless of type or background.

**Implementation Plan**  
The app follows a **four-page structure**:
1. **Logs**: View your past beverages and ratings  
2. **Map**: Discover nearby places you’ve visited or might like  
3. **Profile**: Track your preferences and achievements  
4. **Add Drink**: A floating action button opens this page to log new beverages  


## Planned Features

- Smart drink recommendations based on past ratings  
- Map integration to display favorite or nearby beverage spots  
- Cloud sync for cross-device drink logs  
- Social features for sharing recommendations
